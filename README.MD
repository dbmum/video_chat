# video_chat
This program sends a live video from one sending client to one recieving client. A server handles the interatction and connection between them. To properly run this program, start the server first, then send_client.py, then recieve_client.py.

I would hope to work on this more in the future so that both clients sned and recieve a video, like in skype or face time. The other option would be to adapt this to a broadcasting network, where one broadcaster sends their video to the server, then multiple clients can all tune into the same video and watch live together.
